# CVAlgorithmsFromScratch
Attempt to re-write many Computer Vision and Image Processing algorithms from scratch to learn the inner functionality. Where possible, SIMD extensions or CUDA have been applied to speed up the computations. 

Features:
- Morphological Operations
- BMP decoding and encoding
- Basic shape drawing
- Canny edge
- Convolutions and blurs with normal and separable filters
- Color-space conversions
